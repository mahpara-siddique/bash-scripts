## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
```

2. Make scripts executable:
```bash
chmod +x *.sh
```

## Requirements

- Bash shell environment
- Root/sudo access for some scripts
- Required packages as mentioned in individual script descriptions
- curl (for netchk.sh)
- Standard Unix utilities (grep, sed, awk)

## Security Considerations

- The scripts should be run with appropriate permissions
- Some scripts (like system_info.sh and gradify.sh) may require sudo privileges
- Be cautious with delsec.sh as file deletion is permanent
- Review email configurations in Schedulator.sh before deployment
- Ensure log files accessed by logrism.sh have appropriate read permissions
- Review website URLs before bulk checking with netchk.sh
